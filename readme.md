# Batbox

A tiny filehosting service written in Python using aiohttp.

> Be aware development is still in very early stages!

## About

The Goal of this project is to create an easy to use and selfhost file hosting service.
As such it should never be bloated with features or require too many dependencies.
The use of javascript and various modern webtechnologies should also be kept to a minimum.

## Roadmap

* [] prevent collision of ids
* [] nicer and shorter ids
* [] prettier and easier to use ui
* [] max. file size configurable in config.yml
* [] files automatically deleted after time or number of downloads
  * [] defined in config.yml
  * [] defined by user
* [] display information about number of files and total amount of data hosted
* [] Docker container
* [] create dependency free and ready to use package
  * [] windows
  * [] mac
  * [] linux
* [] favicon and eventually a mascot?
